Contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions you're looking for and how the process works. Contributors will need to go through a series of steps to be able to contribute to your repo on GitHub:

1. Forking your repo You will probably want people to fork your project. Forking means creating a replica of your repository on their GitHub profile.
2. Clone. From there they will clone the project to their local machine.
3. Create a branch. You will want to ask them to create a branch for their work.
4. Focus their change on one area. Ask contributors to concentrate their contributions on one thing at a time - that way the chances that you can merge in their work is higher. Imagine they write a bug fix, add a new feature, and update several tests - what if you want to, or can only implement 2 out of 3, or 1 out of 3 changes?
