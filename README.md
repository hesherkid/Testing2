# Testing2

### New to GitHub

This is my second testing area to make use of. I am testing out how to use **GitHub**, make a *README*. And following along with the Web-Dev-For-Beginners learing guide that I found. 

### Making a README

- Lists important info about your project
- Lets other future collaborators know how to use this project
